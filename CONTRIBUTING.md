# Contributing to Our Church Website
We're really excited that you're about to contribute to the [CHurch website). If this is your first time contributing, please continue reading to learn how to make the most meaningful and useful impact possible.

## Raising an Issue to Encourage a Contribution
If you notice a problem with the repository that you believe needs improvement but you're unable to make the change yourself, you should raise a GitHub issue containing a clear description of the problem. Include relevant snippets of the content and/or screenshots if applicable.
The repository owners regularly review issue lists and your issue will be prioritized and addressed as appropriate.

## Submitting a Pull Request to Suggest an Improvement
If you see an opportunity for improvement and can make the change yourself go ahead and use a typical Git workflow to make it happen:
* Fork this repository
* Make the change on your fork, with descriptive commits in the standard format
* Open a Pull Request against this repo

A curriculum owner will review your change and approve or comment on it in due course.
